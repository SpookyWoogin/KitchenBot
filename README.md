# KitchenBot
KitchenBot is a small, joke bot made using the Python version of the Slack API.

# What does the Repo contain?
Within it you will find a License, the bot itself, and the README that you are currently looking at.

# How does it work?
Since I am lazy and didn't feel like learning a new language, I forged on and used Python 3.7.0 as the language for the bot. The API used is called slackclient. If you've worked on a Discord bot before, then this will look familiar as slackclient acts in a similar manner to the normal branch of Discord.py.

# What will I need to host the bot?
First, you'll need a Slack workspace. This is easy since Slack workspaces are free unless you pay for their paid tier. Once that's done, all you need to do is visit the Slack API website, create a Bot User, and copy it's Bot User OAuth Access Token. That's all! Eventually down the line I will set up the bot for distrubution through Slack instead of having to distribute the code and have you poor souls go through the process of setting up your own bot user.

# Happy Botting!
